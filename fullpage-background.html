A full page background image 

The goal here is a background image on a website that covers the entire browser window at all times. Let's put some specifics on it:

Fills entire page with image, no white space
Scales image as needed
Retains image proportions (aspect ratio)
Image is centered on page
Does not cause scrollbars
As cross-browser compatible as possible
Isn't some fancy shenanigans like Flash
